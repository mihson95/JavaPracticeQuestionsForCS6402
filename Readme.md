# This is an Informal Planned Tutorial for University of Limerick's CS6402 Module for Java Help

## I will post solutions for Java Programming here every week to help students of UL Module CS6402 learn basic syntaxes, and basic programming flows and to aid logic building and knowledge of Core Java
### I was asked to create this repository by student [@CoderSales](https://github.com/CoderSales) as part of being a Lab Teaching Assistant
